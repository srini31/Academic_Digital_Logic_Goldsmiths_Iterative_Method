#Academic: Digital-Logic-Goldsmiths-iterative-method

In this project digital logic for Goldschmidt’s division and square root is implemented. By using the multiplication and division functions available in the data path, complex division is also 
implemented. Since division is very expensive, most hardware devices implement this using software. The significance of the Goldschmidt’s method is that it converts division into an equivalent 
multiplication problem which can be solved inexpensively. Goldschmidt’s method is based on Newton Raphson’s iterations and has quadratic convergence which means that after every iteration, the precision 
is doubled and also eliminates a final multiplication involved in Newton Raphson’s method.
