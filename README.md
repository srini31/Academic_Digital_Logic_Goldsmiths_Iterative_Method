# Academic: Digital-Logic-Goldsmiths-method

The project discusses digital logic implementation for division, square root and complex division using Goldschmidtâ€™s iterative method of multiplicative division and square root. The end result is a very efficient data path with less expensive iterations compared to other iterative division methods. Since it is important to perform an error analysis when making such a bold statement, a comparison of the results with results from a java software program is also performed. The mathematics behind the method is explained and the data path and control logic for the hardware is also thoroughly discussed. The results are illustrated using various diagrams, tables and System Verilog code.
